/* Question:
"I want to categorize the salaries from each job posting. 
To see if it fits in my desired salary range.
Put salary into different buckets
Define whatâ€™s a high, standard, or low salary with our own conditions
Why? 
It is easy to determine which job postings are worth looking at based on salary. 
Bucketing is a common practice in data analysis when viewing categories
Only want to look at data analyst roles
Order from highest to lowest"
